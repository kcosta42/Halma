# Halma

About
-----
>Halma is a strategy board game invented in 1883 or 1884 by George Howard Monks, a US thoracic surgeon at Harvard Medical School. His inspiration was the English game Hoppity which was devised in 1854. The gameboard is checkered and divided into 16Ã—16 squares.

Rules
-----
> Players take turns to move a single piece of their own colour. The piece may either be simply moved into an adjacent square OR it may make one or more hops over other pieces
>
>After each hop, the player may either finish or, if possible and desired, continue by hopping over another piece.
>
>The aim of the game is to be the first to player to move all pieces across the board and into opposing corner.
